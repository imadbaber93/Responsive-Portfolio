      <p id="opening">Hi there! Welcome to my website. My name is Imad Baber and I am a 24 year old engineer working for Verizon Wireless. My main aspiration is to become a full-stack developer which means being able to code both front end and back end logic. I also want to develop and maintain applications while contributing to a team-centric work field. The languages that I currently have foundational knowledge in include: Java, C#, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. My goals currently are to learn Node.js and jQuery and to learn data mining for Big data analytics.</p>
<!-- 
      <p>A little more about me, I currently work in the growing city of Charlotte, North Carloina where I'm also taking a Coding Bootcamp course. At the moment I am a Network Engineer-II and my main job responsibility is to deliver backhaul to Verizon's growing number of cell sites using tools proprietary within Verizon Wireless. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia. During my undergrad I did several rotations as a co-op with Verizon Wireless and I graduated with a gpa of 3.12. I've lived in the northeast suburbs of Atlanta, GA since 2005. Before that I lived in the suburbs of Los Angeles, California for almost 10 years, and before that I lived in Karachi, Pakistan which is where I am originally from. </p> -->

      <p> The activities I enjoy doing include hiking, rock climbing, playing and watching basketball and football, and I also enjoy playing video games from time to time.
